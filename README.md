### This repository contains notebooks for learning active inference.  The Python notebooks use the probabilitic programming language Pyro (built on Pytorch).  The Julia notebooks use the package RxInfer.jl.  Please note that installing and compiling Julia packages on Colab will take a few minutes so you may want to use a local installation of Julia.
